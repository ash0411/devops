docker create( will make init container)
## docker operations##
when the parent process is running(in background) you can run child process 
docker exec -it ash123 sh( for intracting with shell)
docker run --rm alpine ifconfig(--rm removes the container automatically)
## who decide parent process for a container##
docker run -it --rm alpine (you will get a terminal ) ( so if you don't define any parent process than default parent process runs)
it is decided by the developer of docker image
##how to check parent process of python image
docker inspect name_of_image(and there you can default process in cmd)
here we are dumping image internals
## main agenda
to create our own docker image
